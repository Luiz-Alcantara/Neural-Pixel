# Neural-Pixel
**A simple GUI wrapper for stable-diffusion.cpp written using C and GTK 4.**

With Neural Pixel, you can use Stable Diffusion on practically any GPU that supports Vulkan and has at least 3GB of VRAM. This is a simple way to generate your images without having to deal with CUDA/ROCm installations or hundreds of Python dependencies.

## Linux Requirements

- Linux Distro with kernel >= 5.14 (Tested on RHEL 9, Fedora 42, and Arch Linux).

- GTK 4, Vulkan(If using GPU) and libpng installed.
- Install deps on Arch (Change vulkan packages according to your GPU, this is for AMD GPUs):
```
sudo pacman -S gtk4 libpng zlib vulkan-icd-loader vulkan-radeon vulkan-tools
```

- Install deps on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint (Change vulkan packages according to your GPU, this is for AMD GPUs):
```
sudo apt install libgtk-4-1 libpng16-16 zlib1g vulkan-tools mesa-vulkan-drivers
```

- Install deps on Fedora/RHEL (Change vulkan packages according to your GPU, this is for AMD GPUs):
```
sudo dnf install gtk4 libpng zlib vulkan-tools mesa-vulkan-drivers
```

- Install deps on OpenSUSE (Change vulkan packages according to your GPU, this is for AMD GPUs):
```
sudo zypper install libgtk-4-1 libpng16-16 libz1 vulkan-tools libvulkan_radeon libvulkan1
```

- A GPU or iGPU with at least 3GB of VRAM for Vulkan.

## Running on Linux

Download the Linux bundle in the releases tab, extract it and run the "neural_pixel" binary.
If you want to see errors and details, start the application from a terminal and enable the "Terminal Verbose" option in "Extra Opts."

## Windows Requirements

- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable latest: [vc_redist](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170).
- A GPU or iGPU with at least 3GB of VRAM for Vulkan.

## Running on Windows

Download the Windows bundle in the releases tab, extract it and run the "neural_pixel.bat" file.
You can directly run the "neural pixel" binary, but the variable that defines the dark theme will not be applied, so the app may look weird.

## Recommended checkpoints

- For realistic style: [Photon](https://huggingface.co/sam749/Photon-v1/blob/main/photon_v1.safetensors).
- For anime style: [SoteMix](https://civitai.com/models/72182/sotemix).

## Build

You'll need GTK 4 and libpng development libs, then just git clone this repository and run:
```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```
To build on Windows Use MSYS2.

To build sd.cpp follow the instructions on its github page: [Stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp).

## Notes

- SDLX Needs the VAE: [SDXL VAE FP16 Fix](https://huggingface.co/madebyollin/sdxl-vae-fp16-fix/blob/main/sdxl_vae.safetensors).

- At the moment the only upscaling model that works is: [RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B.pth](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases/download/v0.2.2.4/RealESRGAN_x4plus_anime_6B.pth).
